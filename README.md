# operatingsystem

Operating System
Developed by Anushka Parikh, Aditi Tyagi, Shruthii Sathyanarayanan, Alexandria Valdez

For my operating systems, we developed a operating system similiar to the Linux operating system. All programs can work on a single terminal. Operating system can execute user programs in the terminal.

I implied keyboard, interrupt, system call, terminal, video memory, and paging functions and assisted my partners on other functions.
